            <h1 id="heading">SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
            <p id="heading_discription">The Solar System[b] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the
                objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[c] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the
                largest are the eight planets,[d] with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small
                Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger
                than the smallest planet, Mercury.[e]

                The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar
                molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the
                remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner system planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and
                Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer system planets
                are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
                <img src="solar_system.jpeg" id="solar_system_image"> two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn,
                are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and
                Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points
                compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight
                planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

                The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[f] The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of
                Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal.
                Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian
                objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these
                populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is
                considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be.[9][10] Such objects are categorized as dwarf
                planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto, with another trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected to
                be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to being a dwarf planet.[f] In addition to these two regions,
                various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely
                travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the
                smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the
                outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.

                The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like
                region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which
                pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends
                out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period
                comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar
                System is located 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy in the Orion Arm, which
                contains most of the visible stars in the night sky. The nearest stars are within the so-called Local
                Bubble, with the closest Proxima Centauri at 4.25 light-years.
                For most of history, humanity did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most
                people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the
                universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky.
                Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the
                cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric
                system.[11][12]

                In the 17th century, Galileo discovered that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four
                satellites in orbit around it.[13] Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by
                discovering Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn.[14] Around 1677, Edmond Halley
                observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun, leading him to realise that observations of the solar
                parallax of a planet (more ideally using the transit of Venus) could be used to trigonometrically
                determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun.[15] In 1705, Halley realised that repeated
                sightings of a comet were of the same object, returning regularly once every 75–76 years. This was the
                first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the Sun,[16] though this had been theorized
                about comets in the 1st century by Seneca.[17] Around 1704, the term "Solar System" first appeared in
                English.[18] In 1838, Friedrich Bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax, an apparent shift in
                the position of a star created by Earth's motion around the Sun, providing the first direct,
                experimental proof of heliocentrism.[19] Improvements in observational astronomy and the use of uncrewed
                spacecraft have since enabled the detailed investigation of other bodies orbiting the Sun.

            <div>
                <p id="mercury_discription">
                    <img src="mercury_image.jpeg" id="mercury_image">Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar
                    System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the
                    Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
                    Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals,
                    corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's
                    orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never
                    exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon
                    after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear
                    as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the
                    planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which
                    recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.

                    Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a
                    3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis
                    exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][18] As seen from the Sun,
                    in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every
                    two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian
                    years.

                    Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its
                    orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;[b] at perihelion,
                    Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion.
                    Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating
                    that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain
                    heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar
                    System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day
                    across the equatorial regions.[19] The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F).
                    The planet has no known natural satellites.

                        style="padding-right: 4%; padding-left: 4%;">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is
                    named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night
                    sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye
                    in broad daylight.[17][18] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from
                    the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before
                    dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[19] It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days
                    and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about
                    its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but
                    Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.[20] Venus does not have any
                    moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.[21]

                    Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their
                    similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth
                    in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more
                    than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea
                    level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even
                    though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar
                    System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
                    highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in
                    visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[22][23] but these will have vaporized as
                    the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[24] The water has probably photodissociated,
                    and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack
                    of a planetary magnetic field.[25]

                    As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as
                    long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime
                    inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first
                    planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC

                        style="padding-right: 4%; padding-left: 4%;">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only
                    astronomical object known to harbour and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land
                    consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans,
                    seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which
                    together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer
                    layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many
                    millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer
                    core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.

                    Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical
                    regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse
                    gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not
                    only determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other
                    factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most
                    areas and greatly impacts life.

                    Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only
                    natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is
                    tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction
                    between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually
                    slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive
                    of the four rocky planets.

                    According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years
                    ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to
                    affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic
                    organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion
                    years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and
                    geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth,
                    biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass
                    extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8 billion humans
                    live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans
                    increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes, and other life.

                        style="padding-right: 4%; padding-left: 4%;">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the
                    second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries
                    the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".[17][18] The latter
                    refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish
                    appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[19] Mars is a
                    terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters
                    of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

                    The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the
                    tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus
                    Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of
                    Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the
                    Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[20][21] Mars has two
                    moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,
                    similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.[22][23]

                    Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit
                    Mars; launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July
                    1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and
                    captured the first images of another planet from deep space.[24] The Soviet Mars 3 mission included
                    a lander, which achieved a soft landing in December 1971; however, contact was lost seconds after
                    touchdown.[25] On 20 July 1976, Viking 1 performed the first successful landing on the Martian
                    surface.[26] On 4 July 1997, the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars and on 5 July released
                    its rover, Sojourner, the first robotic rover to operate on Mars.[27] The Mars Express orbiter, the
                    first European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft to visit Mars, arrived in orbit on 25 December
                    2003.[28] In January 2004, NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, both landed
                    on Mars; Spirit operated until 22 March 2010 and Opportunity lasted until 10 June 2018.[29] NASA
                    landed its Curiosity rover on August 6, 2012, as a part of its Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission
                    to investigate Martian climate and geology.[30] On 24 September 2014, the Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) became the fourth space agency to visit Mars when its maiden interplanetary
                    mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft, arrived in orbit.[31] The United Arab Emirates became
                    the fifth to successfully undertake a mission to Mars, having inserted an orbiter into the Martian
                    atmosphere on 9 February 2021.[32] China National Space Administration (CNSA)'s Tianwen-1 spacecraft
                    arrived in Martian orbit on 10 February 2021.[33] NASA's Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter
                    successfully landed on Mars on 18 February 2021.[34] Ingenuity successfully completed the first
                    powered controlled flight by an aircraft on any planet besides Earth on 19 April 2021, taking off
                    vertically, hovering and landing on Mars. [35][36] On 14 May 2021, CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and
                    Zhurong rover successfully landed on Mars.[37] Zhurong rover was successfully deployed on 22 May
                    2021, which makes China the second country to successfully deploy a rover on Mars, after the United
                    States

                        style="padding-right: 4%; padding-left: 4%;">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the
                    largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of
                    all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass
                    of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
                    and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter,
                    the king of the gods, because of its observed size.

                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one quarter of its mass and one
                    tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements,[17] but like the other giant
                    planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The on-going contraction of its interior
                    generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the
                    planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the
                    equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with
                    turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great
                    Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century, when it was
                    first seen by telescope.

                    Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's
                    magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter
                    has 80 known moons and possibly many more,[6] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by
                    Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the
                    planet Mercury.

                    Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in
                    December 1973.[18] Jupiter has since been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft,
                    beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo
                    orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995.[19] In 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons
                    probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto.
                    The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.[20][21]
                    Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean
                    of the moon Europa.

                        style="padding-right: 4%; padding-left: 4%;">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
                    second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about
                    nine and a half times that of Earth.[22][23] It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth;
                    however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[24][25][26] Saturn is named
                    after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's
                    sickle. The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") for the
                    planet Saturn.[27]
                    Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface,
                    though it may have a solid core.[32] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate
                    spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar
                    radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km.[10] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other
                    giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the
                    bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is
                    74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the
                    equatorial escape velocity of nearly 36 km/s is much higher than that of Earth

                    Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
                    compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of
                    liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue
                    due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen
                    layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the
                    Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
                    Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[28] The outer atmosphere is
                    generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on
                    Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on
                    Neptune.[29]

                    The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice
                    particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons[30] are known to orbit
                    Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its
                    rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the
                    planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a
                    substantial atmosphere

                        style="padding-right: 4%; padding-left: 4%;">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name
                    is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the
                    great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn).
                    Uranus had been observed on many occasions before its recognition as a planet, but it was generally
                    mistaken for a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by Hipparchos, who in 128 BC might
                    have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy's
                    Almagest.[25] The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least
                    six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed
                    Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[26] including on four consecutive nights.

                    Sir William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King
                    Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy),[27] and initially reported
                    it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet.[28] With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel
                    "engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars It
                    has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus
                    is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from
                    that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus
                    and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is
                    similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains
                    more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[16] It has
                    the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C;
                    −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds
                    and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.[16] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and
                    rock.[15]

                    Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The
                    Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly
                    into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other
                    planets have their equators.[21] In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost
                    featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other
                    giant planets.[21] Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet.[22] Observations from
                    Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in
                    2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

                        style="padding-right: 1.6%; padding-left: 0.8%;">Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar
                    planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the
                    third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly
                    more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because
                    its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun
                    once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is
                    named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the
                    god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.

                    Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
                    mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of
                    Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an
                    unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his observations,
                    independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a
                    telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le
                    Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
                    remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance
                    from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based
                    telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager
                    2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.[17][18] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and
                    large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed
                    observations from afar.

                    Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along
                    with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion of "ices"
                    such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed
                    of ices and rock;[19] Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this
                    distinction.[20] Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue
                    appearance,[21] though an unknown component is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to
                    Uranus.[21]

                    In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has
                    active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the
                    planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More
                    recently, in 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied
